                    Everyone at some point looks at their portfolio of 
                    investments and wonders if there is something better 
                    out there. The answer is a resounding yes, but often 
                    very difficult to find something new and different. 
                    This  requires one to explore the unknown. The truth 
                    is everyone reverts to the “known” or the safe haven 
                    that they have come to rely upon. The reality is that 
                    the safe option is usually associated with low risk and 
                    often low return in exchange for that trust.

                    <h4>So let us start by firstly looking at the options available:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Some opt to do it themselves and become day traders. 
                            This entails learning investing techniques, money management, 
                            risk management and portfolio spread/diversification. This is 
                            by no means an exhaustive list but a high level summary of the 
                            key aspects that need to be learnt and mastered. As one can 
                            appreciate this is a daunting task, fraught with many obstacles. 
                            Many lose money on this journey and eventually succumb to the 
                            “house” which is the market.  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Invest money in a banking institution for a fixed period and in 
                            return a fixed percentage gain. The upside is usually not very 
                            attractive and the downside is that your money is tied up for 
                            lengthy periods. This is often done in uncertain times, so when 
                            the markets start trending once again investors cannot take advantage 
                            of the market shift as the funds are no longer liquid.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Invest money with a fund manager/investment organisation. 
                            This is usually the favoured option for most people as they are 
                            usually better equipped to return reasonable results. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There are some limiting factors on this option:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The funds are fairly inflexible when it comes to agility in the market.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Each fund usually comprises a basket of shares or ETF’s. 
                                    If any of those stocks is an underperformer in the basket, 
                                    very little can be done about it as an unbundling of that 
                                    share would arguably cause chaos in the market.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Rebalancing of the fund happens either quarterly or half 
                                    yearly which attempts to address these issues but usually only 
                                    softens the non-performer issue but doesn’t resolve it.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Now that we have had a look at the regular options lets now discuss why us:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Having had the opportunity to work with a world renowned trader 
                            we gleaned insights that few have the privilege of obtaining. 
                            This has allowed us to develop a system that is unique in the 
                            market place. It combines many different indicators, techniques 
                            and money management functions that make it reliable and consistent
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We have spent 6 years developing and testing the system and 1 year 
                            to risk model the system leading to further significant advancements
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The system revolves around an automated trading system which removes 
                            a lot of bias and emotion, something lots of traders fall foul to
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Additionally the automation allows 24 hour operation which for a human 
                            is physically impossible
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The system is parameter driven which allows vast manoeuvrability and flexibility
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Our system focuses on Forex pairs which makes it a self-hedging 
                            type system based on the way in which the pairs are constructed
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The economic news which is well documented allows us to change 
                            parameters to flow with the market as it changes dynamically
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Additionally we have constructed an AI model that shows weekly 
                            trend predictions to help with parameter setup
                        </li>
