                        Gary Bebington - CEO & Founder
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Garyâ€™s career started out as a software engineer 
                        working for various large corporates including Global 
                        companies such as Accenture and Dimension Data. 
                        He won a global award for implementing the largest BI 
                        solution in the Southern Hemisphere on a Microsoft platform 
                        to name but a few achievements. <br><br>
                        Gary then had the good 
                        fortune to meet and work with Courtney Smith, 
                        a world renowned hedge fund trader/manager and 
                        stock picker. His achievements are virtually unparalled 
                        in the financial world. In that tenure Gary learnt many trade 
                        secrets, trade techniques and money management rules that 
                        few are privy to. This paved the way to design and develop 
                        an unique trading algorithm that incorporates many techniques 
                        and money management strategies.  Gary continues to enhance 
                        the algorithm / robot to not only deliver stellar returns, but 
                        minimise risk in the process.
