                                    Gary’s career started out as a software engineer working for various large
                                    corporates
                                    including Global companies such as Accenture and Dimension Data. He won a global
                                    award for
                                    implementing the largest BI solution in the Southern Hemisphere on a Microsoft
                                    platform to
                                    name but a few achievements.

                                    

                                    Gary then had the good fortune to meet and work with Courtney Smith, a world
                                    renowned hedge
                                    fund trader/manager and stock picker. His achievements are virtually unparalled in
                                    the
                                    financial world. In that tenure Gary learnt many trade secrets, trade techniques and
                                    money
                                    management rules that few are privy to. This paved the way to design and develop an
                                    unique
                                    trading algorithm that incorporates many techniques and money management strategies.
                                    Gary
                                    continues to enhance the algorithm to not only deliver stellar returns, but
                                    minimise risk in the process.
