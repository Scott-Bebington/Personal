                                Everyone at some point looks at their portfolio of
                                investments and wonders if there is something better
                                out there. The answer is a resounding yes, but often
                                very difficult to find something new and different.
                                This requires one to explore the unknown. The truth
                                is everyone reverts to the “known” or the safe haven
                                that they have come to rely upon. The reality is that
                                the safe option is usually associated with low risk and
                                often low return in exchange for that trust.

                <h4 class="pt-3">So let us start by firstly looking at the options available:</h4>
                <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm">

                        <button class="navbar-toggler LearnMoreButton" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"

                            Learn More
                        </button>
                        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="Options">
                            <div class="container-fluid">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Some opt to do it themselves and become day traders.
                                        This entails learning investing techniques, money management,
                                        risk management and portfolio spread/diversification. This is
                                        by no means an exhaustive list but a high level summary of the
                                        key aspects that need to be learnt and mastered. As one can
                                        appreciate this is a daunting task, fraught with many obstacles.
                                        Many lose money on this journey and eventually succumb to the
                                        “house” which is the market.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Invest money in a banking institution for a fixed period and in
                                        return a fixed percentage gain. The upside is usually not very
                                        attractive and the downside is that your money is tied up for
                                        lengthy periods. This is often done in uncertain times, so when
                                        the markets start trending once again investors cannot take advantage
                                        of the market shift as the funds are no longer liquid.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Invest money with a fund manager/investment organisation.
                                        This is usually the favoured option for most people as they are
                                        usually better equipped to return reasonable results.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        There are some limiting factors on this option:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                The funds are fairly inflexible when it comes to agility in the market.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Each fund usually comprises a basket of shares or ETF’s.
                                                If any of those stocks is an underperformer in the basket,
                                                very little can be done about it as an unbundling of that
                                                share would arguably cause chaos in the market.

                                                Rebalancing of the fund happens either quarterly or half
                                                yearly which attempts to address these issues but usually only
                                                softens the non-performer issue but doesn’t resolve it.
