                                Before we get into what markets we trade let’s look at the typical investor.
                                The majority of investors buy stocks, as they are perceived to be “the go to”
                                market place. Most investors get hooked into the STORY or HYPE of the Stock
                                and fall prey to emotional attachment even if the Stock does not perform.
                                Investors tend to become reliant on GURUS to guide their buying decisions.
                                We often hear investors buying “X” number shares without knowing why, other
                                than it sounded like a good idea at the time or bought as much as they could
                                with the capital at hand. In addition to that most investors choose the usual
                                stocks which are often range bound rather than the growth stocks, which are not
                                often spotted until they are already soaring luring would be investors into buying
                                at the top of the trend with little wriggle room for growth.

                                The Stock market is the most spoken about on investing and news shows,
                                so it’s understandable that most investors choose that vehicle, whereas
                                the other 3 are more difficult to understand and commentary on them is
                                rare or non-existent. Stocks are notorious for big unexpected moves and
                                subject to loads of volatility on sporadic news events or comments from
                                “big” named players in the market.

                                    (High leverage in the Currency market gives one the illusion of high volatility,
                                    yet it's overtrading that causes risky trading not volatility)

                                    The Currency market dwarfs all other markets in terms of
                                    volume traded, so it is far less susceptible to market
                                    manipulation or government intervention
                                </li>

                                    The main currency pairs and crosses provide a stable environment,
                                    which is where our system is focused
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The Currency market is very much a cyclical market vs.
                                    the stock market, which is generally a growth market,
                                    allowing us to trade in ranges
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The cyclical nature of the Currency market allows us to
                                    short the market, whereas the stock market is predominantly
                                    a buyer's market, which precludes shorting it for most investors
                                    unless you know how to trade Options to take advantage of bear markets
                                </li>
